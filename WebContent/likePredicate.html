Report of Like Predicate.<br><br><br>

We used the prepared statement for searching function when there can be multiple possible null conditions. <br>
In the query, we use "movies.title = ? or ? is null <br>
this is the case the title should match exactly. <br><br>
We replace the condition with movies.title like CONCAT('%', ?, '%') or ? = '' <br>
and the same goes for movie director and actor name.<br>
So that title director and star supports substring matching.<br>
In this case, as long as the string contains the keyword, the result will be displayed.<br>
